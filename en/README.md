> Facilitates public data visualization and engages people.

Nossa Cidade Transparente is a non-profit project created by volunteers from various areas with the intention of facilitating the engagement of the population with its town, through intuitive interfaces and easy to navigate, bringing citizens an empowerment tool.


<h2>How we do</h2>
We create crawlers for each town to be included in the project, then provide the result of the capture without restriction, and last but not least, we include the captured city in the application. See more about how it looks in the end **[here](https://nossacidadetransparente.herokuapp.com)**.

Through events like **[civic hackathons] (https://medium.com/@nossacidadetransparente/hackathon-c%C3%ADvica-gravata%C3%AD-03-09-2016-52c2a6a6d0c5#.se9mcnraq)** we gather developers who aspire to be part of creating something that can make a difference in our community. All the generated code is available here in the [repository](https://github.com/nossacidadetransparente).

<h2>How to contribute</h2>
There's a lot of ways to help, start taking a look **[here](CONTRIBUTING.md)**, feel free to take some open issue or add a new one.  

<h2>Is this legal?</h2>
 We are an idea aimed at trying to solve a problem of the local community. For this, we will use the Transparency Portal of some towns to monitor and capture data, being promotion channels of public information since the **[Complementary law n° 131/2009](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/lcp/Lcp131.htm)** and **[law nº 12.527/2011 (Access to Information Law)](http://legislacao.planalto.gov.br/legisla/legislacao.nsf/Viw_Identificacao/lei%2012.527-2011?OpenDocument)**.
